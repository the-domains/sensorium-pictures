Meet 9-year-old Ava Fratus - a real-life singer, dancer, actor and rapper, who will star as Jesse, and perform original music written specifically for SNOWFLAKE. Ava started in the business when she was just 6 years old and has been performing up and down the East coast ever since.

## Director's Statement-Cate Carson

A primary reason I signed on to direct this film is because of a central message we will be able to share: "Just. Be. Yourself." Children are increasingly restricted from being themselves at a younger age now - peer pressure, social media, constant messaging that tells them what being "cool", or what being a "girl/boy" means, all play a part. The main character in this film is loosely based on a real 9-year-old girl who pushes boundaries and can teach us all a thing or two about expressing our true selves - no matter what people think, or how they judge you. 

What is amazing about the world of music is this connection we can all have to each other - it truly can unite people. We are living in an age where race, gender, and age are all areas that need reform; this story banishes stereotypes associated with each and it does so through music- Jesse's story of finding her voice. Hopefully someone, somewhere will be affected, be more open-minded, or feel confident enough to just be who they are. If kids aren't given this message, we will have effectively inhibited them from blossoming into the innovators, artists, and leaders of our future. Thank you for supporting this film. We can't wait to make it a reality. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d2c7eafff82195db6391b62a89dfe92b27d2aadc.jpg)
