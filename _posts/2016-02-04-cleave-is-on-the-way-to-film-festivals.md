# \#CLEAVE - 2016 - a 28 minute short film

## A blue-collar couple living the "American dream" suffer from remaining loyal to a failing and toxic marriage.  

Why is it we remain loyal to things that are so divisive in our lives? 

Nadia and Aidan have built a blue-collar life in small town America. Outside looking in, they achieved the American dream -a house in a quiet suburban neighborhood and two kids. But at this dark cross-section, their marriage is failing, both of them clinging to the toxicity that is suffocating them. In HIM and HER, we see the fear of change at war with what they both want. Will they remain loyal to something that is tearing them apart?

A @sensoriump production in association with 42/24 Films. Sensoriteam: Directed by @catecarson, produced and edited by @justinplasse.
